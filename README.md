The bitcoin server is already supposed to be running when you interact with this GUI application.

The gui contains, in order:

A setup button that sets up the first wallet, based on the string you've typed. And the field which you're supposed to type it in.

A button to generate the wallet you're supposed to send to and the field for the name for the wallet.

A field where the generated address is, use this to paste into the target address field.

The field you copy the address into.

A field that takes the amount you want to send from the main wallet, to the second generated wallet. And a send button
The balance that's on the main wallet, and the info from running the listunspent command, which only shows up if you click the button below, which updates balance and displays the list unspent string.
